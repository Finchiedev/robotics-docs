Welcome!

*RoboHUD is a GUI created for the King's Legacy robotics team for use in the RoboCup international competition that takes place yearly*

If you want to get straight to the code, it is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/finchiedev/robotics-gui>`_

This documentation aims to cover the following:

* What RoboHUD is
* How to install all of the relevant tools in order to develop the GUI
* How the code works

If you have any questions at any point, feel free to contact Angus Finch via `email <mailto://1012752@student.ccgs.wa.edu.au>`_, in the CCGS Robotics Discord server or in TG11 most days after school.
You can also have a conversation with Mr. Nolan or one of the senior members for some help.

Next up: an introduction to Electron
