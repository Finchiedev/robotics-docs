Welcome to the **RoboHUD** guide! The aim of this guide is to provide a complete introduction into the software behind the robots of the CCGS King's Legacy RMRC team. The guide currently has four main parts, which are:

* A Python development guide, including how to implement Dynamixel servos and communication with other devices
* A NodeJS development guide, providing an introduction into developing additional features for the GUI
* A command line guide to help new Linux users get a feel for the terminal
* A software development guide, introducing users to the basics of a Git workflow and how it is used by our team
