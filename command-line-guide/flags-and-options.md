# Flags and options

Have you seen a command that has `-` or `--` with some words or letters after it? For example, consider the command `ls -a`. What this does mean? Well, the command `ls` is being given the argument `a`. This is shorthand for `ls --all`, which tells the command that it should **not** ignore entries starting with `.`. In the next section you will learn what this means, but for now just remember the following

* A flag is an option, that tells the command to do certain things
* Traditionally, flags have a shorthand name \(e.g. `-a`\) and a longhand name \(e.g. `--all`\)
* You can stack shorthand flags \(e.g. `-laS` is the same as `-l -a -S`\)
* **Capitalisation matters.** There is a difference between `-b` and `-B` for `ls`
